Visualization of 2D stress element at different planes


This purpose of this code is to create a versatile code for analyzing and visualization of a 2D stress element using different planes.

This project is divided into 3 parts
- Visualization of 2D stress element 
- Finding Principle stresses and their planes using fundamental formulas
- Finding Maximum and Minimum Shear stresses and their planes
